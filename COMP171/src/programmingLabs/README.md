Edits were made to the names of the assignments and the comments. The code was left as-is. This was done for my sake, as refreshing one's memory on syntax is easier when done sequentially, and the lab names offer no indication of the order submitted. 

Comments addded were the problems, both the requirements and sample output, as well as hints as to how to solve them.
